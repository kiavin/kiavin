## 🤖 Kali Linux & Cybersecurity Fun

I use **Kali Linux**, which means I'm either a security enthusiast...  
or I just really like breaking my own system and fixing it again. 😆🔓  
Enjoy playing with tools like `nmap`, `Wireshark`, `hydra`, and more.

## ⚙️ Nginx Configuration - The Art of Debugging

Configuring **Nginx** is fun...  
until you see **"502 Bad Gateway"** and spend hours wondering if it's your app, your proxy, or just Nginx messing with you. 😅
